            <p class="mb-4">
                I attest that I am the duly elected Class Representative for my section. I understand that borrowing keys or rooms without this authorization is a punishable infraction.

            <p class="mb-4">
                I agree to surrender my valid, current-semester PUP ID as security. I understand that my ID will only be returned once all room handover requirements (cleanliness, photos, key return) are met.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">1.3. No Proxy</h3>

                I acknowledge that I cannot use another student's ID to borrow a room unless that student is also a Class Representative and present.
